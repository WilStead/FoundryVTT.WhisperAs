Thank you for taking the time to engage with this project. Community contributions help make my code more reliable, useful, and efficient.

# Contributing

All contributions should start with an issue in the repository's [tracker](https://github.com/WilStead/FoundryVTT.WhisperAs/issues).

Before filing an issue, please follow these troubleshooting steps if the issue you are filing is a bug:

1. Verify that your version of Foundry VTT is listed as a supported version in this module's `module.json` file.
1. Verify that this module is updated to the latest version. If the latest version doesn't support your current version of Foundry VTT, please update Foundry VTT to at least the minimum supported version of this module's latest release.
1. Disable all modules except this one, and verify that your issue can still be reproduced.

## Pull requests

First of all, thank you for your willingness to make a contribution to this project. Your assistance, time, and effort are greatly appreciated.

Please refrain from submitting a [pull request](https://help.github.com/articles/using-pull-requests) before an issue has been filed in the repository's [tracker](https://github.com/Tavenem/Blazor.MarkdownEditor/issues). You should usually wait for the issue to receive feedback from the project maintainer(s), as well. There will be times when a pull request won't be the appropriate resolution to the issue.

Please ensure that the module still works correctly by testing it locally, before submitting a pull request.
